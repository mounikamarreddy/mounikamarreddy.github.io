I am a fourth-year PhD student at [IIITHyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), working in the [Language Technology Research Center (LTRC)](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/), advised by [Radhika Mamidi](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/radhikamamidi/). My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for NLP tasks in resource poor languages. I am currently working on **Text Classification** in low resource languages. I want to build systems which can understand Indian languages and classify the text related to the NLP task.

I completed my M.Tech from University Of Hyderabad in 2016 from Artificial Intelligence group. I have worked as Data Scientist at Quadratyx (India).
