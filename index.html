<br>I am a fourth-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a>, working in the <a href="https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/">Language
Technology Research Center (LTRC)</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/radhikamamidi/">Radhika Mamidi</a>. My research interests lie 
in the application of machine learning methods for NLP tasks in resource poor languages. I am currently working on Text Classification in low resource languages. 
I want to build systems which can understand Indian languages and classify the text related to the NLP tasks.<br><br>

I completed my M.Tech from University Of Hyderabad in 2016 from Artificial Intelligence group. I have worked as Data Scientist at Quadratyx (India).
